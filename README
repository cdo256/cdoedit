cdoedit - simple text editor
--------------------
cdoedit is a simple text file editor for X intended only for my personal use.


Requirements
------------
In order to build cdoedit you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (cdoedit is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install cdoedit (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Credits
-------
cdoedit is based on Suckless' Simple Terminal (st).
st in turn is based on Aur√©lien APTEL <aurelien dot aptel at gmail dot com> bt source code.

Files
-----
cdoedit.c handles just the grid of glyphys that form the display buffer.
editor.c manages the gap buffer and has convenient edit operations. This file is brand new since the st fork.
x.c does all the interaction with the xserver. This file is mostly unchanged since the st fork.
